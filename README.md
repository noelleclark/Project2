### Summary of the Project:

The data set the project has data on recorded global shark attacks from the years 1845-2018. The data set has information about the dates the attacks occurred, the specific location of the attack, the activity of the person who was attacked (ex: surfing), the sex and age of the person who was attacked, the type of injury, species of shark (if known), etc.

In this project, we were interested in tracking the number of shark attacks over time. We noticed there was a trend that increased over time, likely due to more record keeping of shark attacks in more recent years. In addition, we were interested to see what the differences were between the number of attacks recorded that had male or female victims. In general, the recorded shark attacks had a higher proportion of male victims than female. We also tracked number of fatal shark attacks over time, separating them by male and female groups. 

### Significance of the Project: 

This data set can be analyzed to look for patterns in an attempt to understand why shark attacks happen. This information could potentially help educate the public about the topic and decrease the chances that shark attacks happen. 

In addition, many in the general public have a fear of sharks or being attacked by a shark, so the public should be educated on the rate of occurrence of these attacks and why attacks happen. For instance, many shark attacks are considered provoked, or when a human touches/ makes contact with a shark. 

### Directions for installation of required packages

Required Software: R and R studio

Steps: 

1. Clone the repository 

2. Open the "doc" folder and then open "Project2.Rmd"

3. Uncomment and install packages if they are not already in your library (run the code underneath the “Libraries” subtitle)

4. Install patchwork package before downloading the patchwork library if not already installed. 

5. At this point, you should run the rest of the code chunks in order to view the visualizations.
